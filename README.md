# ZG_Portfolio

This is my self made professional portfolio.
<br>
The design and layout of the portfolio are meant to mimic my resume in order to create brand continuity.
<br>
The layout of the page is simple. At the top is the About Me section, giving the viewer a little background information about myself as well as links for them to contact me or check out my other references. The second section contains my Graphic Design work with a brief explanation about the concept of each project and how it was made. Lastly is my Web Development work. Like my Graphic Design section, the Web Development section shows a screenshot of each project, contains the same basic info about each project but also includes links for the viewer to go see the code directly or to pull of the project in a new page to check out how it works for themselves.
