            <img src="assets/images/Professional Image Cropped.jpg" width="300px">
            <p id="abouttext">I graduated from California State University of Fullerton in May 2017 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in
                Graphic Design. Most of my work is made through Adobe Illustrator with some help from Adobe Photoshop. I
                am most experienced in print based graphic design, including things such as beer labels, business cards,
                icons, logos and fliers.</p>
            <p id="abouttext">My hobbies include reading, watching movies, playing video games and above all, scuba diving. There is nothing
                I would rather be doing than scuba diving. I've dove inside a sunken ship, through dormant lava tubes, drifted
                along underwater currents and gone as deep as 100 feet below the surface. Most notably, I've dove with sea
                turtles, manta rays and hammerhead sharks!</p>

                                grew exponetially while working on it and I could truly feel the progress I was making in
                                the coding bootcamp. Inspired by "Dungeons & Dragons" game logic and "Skyrim" visuals.

                                <strong>Concept:</strong> Create a stock tracking application. I was responsible for creating the chart to display the stocks.
                                This was an extremely frustrating project as my team decided upon using React to create the application and at the time I was brand new to the language.
                                It was also frustrating because the library we decided to use for the chart, Chart.js, worked wonderfully in Javascript/jQuery 
                                but presented numerous errors when trying to merge it with React.

                                <strong>Concept:</strong> Learn a new library for using charts in coding. 
                                Chart.js is easy to use and learn, and comes equipped with every type of chart the user could need.
                                The two biggest challenges with this project were getting the chart to dynamically update on a set interval,
                                and getting it to apply those updates to every dataset at once regardless of there are 1, 2, 10 or even 0 datasets currently active.
